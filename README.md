A program to calculate the parameters of a turbofan:
Based on the book Aircraft Engine Design by John Mattingly I developed a standalone program with GUI that calculates the parameters of bypass dual-spool turbojet engines with or without an afterburner.

Here I present a github repository with my software, which also contains a manual describing the usage of this application (only in polish).

Important: please note, that this program requires Matlab Compiler Runtime to run.
